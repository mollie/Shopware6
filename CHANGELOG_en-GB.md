- Full refunds do now take already pending (partial) refunds into account. It's now way easier to also refund the rest amount of an order

After checkout, the original cart will be restored

## [4.0.0] - 2023-06-07
### Breaking Changes
The new version 4.0 has been restructured to support both Shopware 6.4 and the new Shopware 6.5 with one single plugin. This means that the Javascript in the Storefront is now loaded from a separate mollie-payments.js file. That behaviour can of course be turned off if you want to build the storefront on your own (please see documentation for more). If you do not see iDEAL dropdown or credit card components, then this could mean that your (custom) theme does accidentally override the Shopware default theme in a wrong way.

### Features
- Full support for Shopware 6.5
- Renamed the “Credit Card” components to “Card” because it also allows debit cards.

### Fixes
- Fixed wrong static quantity of “1” when building shipping items for Mollie. Custom implementation with different quantities will now also be correctly passed on to Mollie.
- Fixed “division-by-zero” error on missing tax rates in the order for rare cases of shop configurations.
- Fixed error in the Refund Manager ACL. Restricted user roles got an error when creating refunds, although the refund was always correctly passed on to Mollie.

### Fixes
- Orders with refunds can now be deleted again according to the Shopware standard.
- Fixed compatibility issue with NetInventors' "Prices after login..." plugin.
- Fix problems with the automatic route detector for webhooks in headless shops based on Symfony Flex (.ENV parameter problem)
- Removed the logs entry "Product is no longer a subscription product.." which was incorrectly always created.
- Fixed a TWIG template error in combination with One-Click Payments and Shopware 6.3.5.x
- Wrong "associations" were removed when loading orders, which led to ugly log entries.

## [3.5.0] - 2023-02-23
### Hints
- The plugin configuration "final order status" now only has the expected entries of the status list. Please check whether the configuration is still correct after the update.

- The Refund Manager now offers the option of specifying internal comments for refunds in addition to official account statement descriptions.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed the Javascript issue due to Apple Pay Direct in the storefront.
- Fixed the problem where an automatic "cancellation" of Klarna orders via administration did not use the correct API key of the sales channel.
- Fixed the problem where anonymizing the URL in the logs didn't work properly. However, this only applies to tokens that are used once during the payment process.

## [3.4.0] - 2023-01-10
### Breaking changes
- For the future extensions for subscriptions we had to adjust the webhooks for them. If there are firewall rules for this, these rules must be adjusted for the new webhooks: https://github.com/mollie/Shopware6/wiki/Webhooks
- Statuses (badges) for subscriptions are no longer loaded directly from Mollie but are obtained from the local database. This new and empty field is usually filled in automatically. If status entries are unexpectedly empty, please let us know.
- Since we always strive to deliver the best quality, we were forced to stop supporting older Shopware versions below 6.3.5. If this is a problem, please contact us to find a possible solution. We regret this step and ask for your understanding. This is the only way to maintain high quality in the long term.

### Features
- New management for subscriptions. These can now also be paused, renewed or suspended (once).

- Unintentional spaces in the salutation of an address are now filtered out. This led to problems with orders.
- Add new debug log entries for all changes of payment status and order status (Order State Management)
- Apple Pay log entries are now only created if Apple Pay is also active. These were always created by mistake.
- Apple Pay does not support a company name. Therefore, a company name stored in the account is now also removed when paying with Apple Pay Direct, since the address of Apple Pay should always be used here.

### Fixes
- Fixed broken snippets for Flow Builder triggers since Shopware 6.4.18
- Fixed an incorrect rounding display of "shipping" amount values ​​in the administration

## [3.0.0] - 2022-09-12
### (Possible) Breaking Changes
The new version 3.0 offers official support for "headless" shops. With the help of "Automatic Route Detection" we have tried to avoid "breaking changes" for new and old payments. Should a problem arise, we have instructions here: https://github.com/mollie/Shopware6/wiki/Headless-setup-in-Shopware-6

### Fixes

## [2.4.0] - 2022-08-10
### Features

- The Shopware standard behaviour for failed payments is now activated by default when the plugin is installed the first time.

### Fixes
- When creating subscriptions, the mandate of the initial payment was not used explicitly. If the customer already has several mandates, Mollie may have used the wrong one for recurring payments.
- The "additional" field in the address is no longer sent to Mollie if there are only spaces in it. This caused a problem when creating the payment.
- Fixed warnings for "CLI commands" in combination with the PSR Logger, Shopware 6.4.10.1 and PHP 8.0

- The detail view of an order in the Administration does now show the Paypal or SEPA reference number.
- The Refund Manager does now show the total sum with and without taxes

### Fixes
- Fix edge case problem where an expired order could not be re-paid from within the Storefront.

## [2.2.2] - 2022-05-11
### Features
- With the new setting "Final order status" you can lock a selected status as the final status. From this point on, the status will only be changed in the case of refunds and chargebacks. This feature is particularly helpful in combination with logistics plugins and logistics processes that differ from Mollie.

### Improvements
- The payment status "expired" now leads to an order status of "cancelled" instead of "failed". This is more in line with reality.
- Compatibility support for the "Article number direct URL" plugin.

### Fixes
- The plugin now ignores webhook updates for orders that started with Mollie, but were not ultimately completed with Mollie.
- Fixed an issue with the checkout in combination with mixed tax rates, discount codes and using a net-price customer group

## [2.2.1] - 2022-04-27
### Features
- We've added the brand new "Smart Contact Form" as new support option in plugin configuration. If you use this for support, we will automatically get all data that we need to help you as good as possible.

### Improvements
- Improved and fixed handling of orders with different tax rates and promotions. Due to technical circumstances a promotion in Mollie is also 1 line item. Because of the fact that only 1 tax rate is possible, a mixed tax rate for promotions is now calculated and used inside Mollie to at least ensure that orders like this can be completed.

### Fixes
- Fix problem with Refund Manager and specific API keys for different Sales Channels. It should now always use the correct API key from the Sales Channel of the order.
- Fix problem where the Mollie Limits feature accidentally reduced payment methods in the account and logos in the footer. Please also clear your caches after updating.

## [2.2.0] - 2022-03-23
### Features
- Release of the brand new Refund Manager in Administration and for your API. Handle full refund processes with transactions, stock and Flow Builder events in an intuitive refund form.
- New Apple Pay Display Restrictions in the plugin configuration allow you to hide Apple Pay Direct buttons on different pages without coding.
- New MollieOrderBuilder Event to customize metadata when creating orders (Feature for developers).

### Improvements
- Important change and fix for the Order Transactions in Shopware. When a customer creates additional payment attempts if the first one fails, then the status history in the Administration and API got out of sync. Mollie will now always use the correct latest transaction of Shopware and append the new status to this transaction and keep it consistent.
- SEPA transaction will now stick with "In Progress" if started and will not transition back to "Open".
- Payments with status "Created" will now be detected as "failed". This should not happen by Mollie, but did somehow.
- Credit Card payments with status "Open" will now be detected as "failed". This should also not happen.
- Apple Pay Direct will now use the Shopware customer number range when creating new guest accounts.
- Replaced Javascript code in Apple Pay Direct to remove error outputs in Internet Explorer.
- Removed jQuery to prepare for Shopware 6.5.
- Improved performance of the "voucher availability" detection when working with a large set of products.
- ING'Homepay will now always be disabled when updating payment methods. This payment method is deprecated in Mollie since a while.
- Removed automatic activation of Mollie payment methods when installing the plugin. This led to a problem due to ING'Homepay, and one would not expect this to happen in that place.

### Fixes
- Fix problem that some fields such as images and names of payment methods got removed and set back to factory defaults after updating them.
- Fix problem with payment methods that were imported twice on an update. (This does not fix previously duplicated methods though).
- Fix a problem with the IPAnonymizer in combination with IPv6 inside the Logging module.
- Fix broken "update payment method" button in the plugin configuration in older Shopware versions.
- Fix rare problem where "checkSystemConfigChange()" in the Mollie plugin threw an exception.
- Fix a problem where shipping wasn't possible due to missing data in the Administration (Cannot read a.shippedQuantity)
- Fix very rare problem of an exception when using the "Mollie Limits" feature.
- Fix Javascript error that is visible if iDEAL is assigned to a Sales Channel but Mollie isn't even configured correctly.

## [2.1.2] - 2022-03-16
This version brings support for the latest Shopware 6.4.9.0. The previous version was never meant to be available for this Shopware version. The Shopware store did unfortunately automatically approve the new Shopware version, which has been turned off for the future. We are sorry for any inconvenience.

## [2.1.1] - 2022-02-16
### Improvements
- Due to a bug (NEXT-20128) in the current Shopware version 6.4.8.x there is a Javasript error "HTML element not found" on every page in the shop. We want the best for you, so we've figured out a way to get rid of this error.

## [2.1.0] - 2022-02-15
### Features
- The new configuration "Mollie Payment Limits" helps you to automatically hide payment methods that are not available by Mollie for the current cart total amount. You can of course use your Shopware availability rules from the Rule Builder and also use the optional Mollie Limits on top of it.
- We present the new plugin configuration. Improved onboarding, improved structure and more descriptions help you with an even easier configuration of the plugin.

### Improvements
- Apple Pay Direct payments do now also get additional information like the Mollie-ID, etc. in the "Custom Field" of the Shopware order.
- Avoiding of Javascript errors in the shipment section of an order in the Administration. This is just an additional optimization.

### Fixes
- SEPA bank transfer payments with status "open" do now lead to a successful order.
- PayPal payments with status "pending" do now lead to a successful order.
