## Easy Testing

Running Cypress tests is easy!
Just install it by using the built in makefile commands
and either open your tests in the Cypress UI, or run them directly from your CLI.


### Installation

This folder contains a `makefile` with all required commands.
Run the installation command to install Cypress and all its dependencies on your machine

```ruby 
make install
```


### Cypress UI
If you want to run your Cypress UI, just open it with the following command.
Please note, because this is an Open Source project, we cannot include a
shop URL in the configuration. Thus you need to provide it on your own.

```ruby 
make open-ui url=http://localhost
```

### Run in CLI
You can also use the CLI command to run Cypress on your machine or directly
in your build pipeline.

```ruby 
make run url=http://localhost
```
